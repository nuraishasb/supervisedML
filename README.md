Supervised machine learning involves training algorithms on labeled data, where both inputs and corresponding outputs are provided. Its goal is to learn the mapping between inputs and outputs so that it can make accurate predictions or classifications on unseen data.

In this mini project, I've utilized the following supervised learning models:
\
*Classification*: LDA, QDA, Logistic Regression, KNN
\
*Regression*: Linear Regression, Best Subsets, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression
