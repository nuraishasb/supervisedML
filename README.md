Supervised machine learning involves training algorithms on labeled data, where both inputs and corresponding outputs are provided. Its goal is to learn the mapping between inputs and outputs so that it can make accurate predictions or classifications on unseen data.

In my R report, I experiment the use of supervised ML on 2 different data sets. We begin with the Classification analysis on the Breast Cancer data set, before moving on to the Regression analysis on the Boston data set. I did the same in my Python report solely using the Insurance data set.

In this mini project, I've utilized the following supervised learning models:
\
*Classfication*: LDA, QDA, Logistic Regression, KNN
\
*Regression*: Linear Regression, Best Subsets, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression
